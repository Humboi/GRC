    <string name="history">It’s been nearly 120 years since our British colonialists constructed the first railway lines. The colonial infrastructure made over a century ago helped shape the economic geography of Ghana. As a British colony, Ghana (then known as the Gold Coast) was developed by Europeans for Europeans. At the time, railways were considered the best mode of transportation. How else could that many goods and produce and minerals be transported back then. STC was not in service.\n\n
    The railway system of Ghana began in 1898 under the Gold Coast Civil Service, with its headquarters at Sekondi. But after the construction of the Takoradi Harbour, it was transferred to Takoradi. The purpose of the railroad was to transport minerals and crops from the mainland to the harbour, which were then shipped to Europe.\n\n
    Two railway lines, built by the British in 1898-1918, were primarily established for military domination against natives or other colonial powers. But the railways also supported the extensive extraction of precious minerals and cash crop agriculture. The first railroad, the Western line, linked the coastal town of Sekondi with the gold-rich enclaves of Obuasi and Tarkwa and was then extended to the hinterland city of Kumasi for military domination. Mining required the transportation of heavy machinery, large quantities of firewood (or coal), and labourers from other regions. European mining companies reaped benefits through this railway system of precious minerals such as gold bauxite, manganese, and diamonds.\n\n
    Fun Fact: The Governorship of William E. Maxwell (1895-97) was instrumental in shaping the railway system back then, because he had previous experience in Malay State where railways were used in tin mines.\n\n
    The second, the Eastern line, linked the capital city of Accra to the network through Kumasi, affecting the economic and spatial development of Ghanaians through integration. This railway connectivity strongly affected the production of cash crops such as coffee and cocoa. As soon as the second line opened, farmers decided to use it to transport crops, massively decreasing their transportation costs (aha!).\n\n
    In 1919, Sir Gordon Guggisberg was appointed governor of the Gold Coast. He believed that the country was capable of attaining the development levels of Europe. He undertook the development and extension of the railway system, built a seaport, and constructed an extensive network of roads. Guggisberg focused on promoting the growth of the economy to give Ghana a competitive advantage in the world market. His policy aimed at rapid development of the country. By the mid-1920s, rail lines covered large portions of the southern part. The expenses accounted for 31.4% of total public expenditure between 1898-1931.\n\n
    Around 80% of cocoa, the country’s main export commodity, was transported through rail, making Ghana the world’s largest exporter of the crop by 1911. By 1927, cocoa amounted to 80% of Ghana’s exports. By the 1960s, railways transported nearly 2 million tonnes of freight and 8 million passengers a year. This cheaper, convenient mode of transportation was a quicker way to carry more cargo.\n\n

                  Isaac Ansong is committed to ensuring that the app is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for

                  The [GRC] app stores and processes personal data that
                  you have provided to us, in order to provide my
                  Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                  that the [GRC] app won’t work properly or at all.
                </p> <!----> <p>
                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  Isaac Ansong will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but Isaac Ansong
                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                  have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                  other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, Isaac Ansong cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                  Isaac Ansong cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to Isaac Ansong’s responsibility for your
                  use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                  bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Isaac Ansong accepts no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                  currently available on Android – the requirements for
                  system(and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the app. Isaac Ansong does not promise that it
                  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the Android version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                  (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                  from your device.
